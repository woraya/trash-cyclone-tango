# Trash Cyclone Tango

This repository for Magic Windows and Mixed-Up Realities class assignments.

Trash Cyclone aims to bring awareness on how much trash we create in our daily life. By using Google Project Tango's Motion Tracking feature to mark the user as the center of the universe with one main gravitational attraction force, the user becomes an attractor that attracts all the trash in the app. The user has to move or run away from these trash. Otherwise, the user's physical and virtual view will slowly become dark and eventually become part of the rest of the trash he/she created.
